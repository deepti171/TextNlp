# TextNlp



#  Natural language processing
#  Introduction
Natural language processing (NLP) can be used to answer a variety of questions about unstructured text, as well as facilitating open-ended exploration. It can be applied to datasets such as emails, online articles and comments, tweets and novels. Although the source is text, transformations are applied to convert this data to vectors, dictionaries and symbols which can be handled very effectively by q. Many operations such as searching, clustering, and keyword extraction can all be done using very simple data structures, such as feature vectors.

# Features
The NLP allows users to parse dataset using the spacy model from python in which it runs tokenisation, Sentence Detection, Part of speech tagging and Lemmatization. In addition to parsing, users can cluster text documents together using different clustering algorithms like MCL, K-means and radix. 

In this project we will run sentiment analysis  which indicates whether a word has a positive or negative sentiment.

# Dependencies
The following python packages are required:
pandas  
numpy  
beautifulsoup4
